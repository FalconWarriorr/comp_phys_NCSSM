    "Population growth for living organism can be simplified into a formula that is similar to that with which we determine the compound interest in a savings account.  It is based on a growth rate (r), an initial population (Ni), a special mathematical constant (e), which is called either Euler’s Number (NOT Euler’s constant, which is different) or Napier’s Constant (we’ll use 2.71828) , the time period (t) in which to determine the change in population size, and the final projected population (Nf).  We can calculate the new population using the formula  . As an example, if an initial population of bacteria is 39,000, If the bacteria follow an exponential growth pattern with rate r = 0.02, (a) what will be the population after 5 hours, and (b) what is the actual amount of growth as a percentage? \n",
